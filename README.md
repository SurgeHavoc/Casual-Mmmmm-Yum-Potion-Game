# Casual-Mmmmm-Yum-Potion-Game

## Description
Brewjeria is a collection of five apothecary themed minigames developed using Unity 6 Preview and C#. In this game, the player starts with a fun little dance game where the player must quickly press the correct directional keys to have the seed dance the right sequence and begin to grow into a plant! After the dance minigame, there is a claw minigame in which the player must "Grab!" at the right time using keyboard, mouse, or a game controller to try and collect all the ingredients out of the ground before the time runs out! These first two minigames are completed, with a third and fourth in progress.

### Motivation
This game takes inspiration from titles such as Potion Craft, Potionomics, and WarioWare Mega Microgames. Both Potion Craft and Potionomics directly inspired the main potion making narrative game concept as well as the aesthetic of the title. The WarioWare Mega Microgames inspired the fast-paced potion making minigame format.
